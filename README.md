* Here is an example of a simple "guess the number" game:

The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess the number.

The program will give feedback after each guess, telling the user whether their guess was too high or too low.

The game ends when the user guesses the correct number or enters 'q' to quit the game.
